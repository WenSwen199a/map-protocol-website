# What are gas fees?

In the context of MAP Protocol, gas fees are small charges incurred for the computational efforts required to process transactions on the MAP Relay Chain. These fees serve as a mechanism to fairly allocate network resources and discourage spam or malicious activities. Unlike typical blockchain platforms where gas fees are a standard feature, MAP Protocol only charges gas fees for cross-chain transactions processed on the MAP Relay Chain.


# What causes gas fees?

Gas fees are generated whenever a transaction is performed that involves transferring data or assets across different blockchain networks using MAP Protocol's MAP Relay Chain. 

The more complex the transaction, the higher the gas fees. Fees are also influenced by network congestion; during times of high activity, fees might go up. **Maintainers**, who are responsible for updating and maintaining Light-Clients on MAP Protocol, can earn extra rewards beyond these gas fees.


# How do I pay gas fees?

Payment for gas fees is made in MAPO, the native token of the MAP Protocol on the MAP Relay Chain. When a user initiates a cross-chain transaction, the required gas fees are automatically calculated and subtracted from the user's MAPO balance. 

Messenger, part of the MAP Omnichain Services (MOS), pre-pays these gas fees for the MAP Relay Chain as well as the destination chain. dApp developers have the flexibility to determine the fee structure for these cross-chain transactions through the Messenger SDK provided by MAP Protocol.


# How are gas fees calculated on MAP Protocol? 

The calculation of gas fees on MAP Protocol is based on several factors, including the type of transaction, the computational complexity involved, and the current state of network congestion. Unlike traditional single-chain models where gas fees are relatively straightforward, MAP Protocol deals with cross-chain transactions, adding an extra layer of complexity to gas fee calculations. Fees may also vary based on the reward model set up by Maintainers and dApp developers using the network.

By adhering to a cost-optimized revenue model, MAP Protocol aims to keep these fees as low as possible to encourage a thriving ecosystem around its Omnichain Services, including Vault & Data deployments for asset and data management.

In summary, gas fees on MAP Protocol are designed to be both efficient and flexible, allowing for a range of applications and services to operate seamlessly in a cross-chain environment while maintaining network integrity and security.
