Bitcoin is by far the largest, most well-known blockchain. It boasts the most decentralized and largest crypto community, as well as a large group of miners that maintain the network's decentralized and stable operation. Due to the lack of Turing completeness, Bitcoin is limited in its usability compared to Ethereum.

If one can transfer assets from other Turing-complete public chains such as Ethereum to the Bitcoin network via ZK-based cross-chain mechanisms, leveraging the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network to enhance asset security as well as interoperability, this will be a major technical conundrum unbundled.


# **From Bitcoin-level peer-to-peer cross-chain communication to Bitcoin layer-2**

From its very first line of code, MAP Protocol embodies Satoshi Nakamoto's peer-to-peer, no-third-party philosophy and has refactored light clients with ZK technology. Via light client’s independent self-verifying nature, MAP Protocol has achieved this purely peer-to-peer, third-party-free cross-chain verification network.

Now, MAP Protocol will also serve as a Bitcoin layer-2, leveraging the Bitcoin network’s security mechanism to further strengthen MAP Relay Chain’s security, expanding the Bitcoin ecosystem, and bridging new trading experiences to the BRC-20 community.


# **What does it mean for MAP Protocol as a Bitcoin layer-2?**

Bitcoin network may have the most robust security. Since the first transaction block in 2009, the network has never once shut down, nor has any Bitcoin ever been stolen from the blockchain. Bitcoin itself serves as a beacon for the entire crypto community. 

One of the most commonly discussed technical issues for Bitcoin ecosystem interoperability is how to enable assets and users on other chains to transfer from other public chains to the Bitcoin network via peer-to-peer cross-chain. Serving as a Bitcoin layer-2, MAP Protocol aims to achieve that. Below is what you can expect with MAP Protocol as a Bitcoin layer-2.


## **Further enhanced MAP Protocol network security powered by the Bitcoin network**

MAP Relay Chain is the hub for interoperability with all blockchain networks, and all cross-chain interoperability transaction requests will pass through MAP Relay Chain. The relay chain uses a classic PoS consensus mechanism, where consensus nodes need to [stake MAPO](/stake-mapo) to process cross-chain transaction requests on the MAP Protocol network.

Every epoch, MAP Relay Chain’s PoS consensus, and other related information on the network will be written into the Bitcoin block as transactions. This will prevent [long-range attacks](/article?id=understanding-Long-Range-attacks) on the relay chain, and the security of the relay chain is thus ensured by the security of the Bitcoin network.


## **Level up the BRC-20 tokens market liquidity with BRC-201**

MAP Protocol’s technical community has released the [BRC-201 protocol](/article?id=from-BRC-20-to-EVMs), which enables BRC-20 and ORC-20 assets on the Bitcoin network to cross-chain and be transferred to MAP Protocol — a Bitcoin layer-2. This cross-chain ability will allow BRC-20 tokens on the Bitcoin network to interact with other tokens on other public chains, thus increasing the market liquidity for BRC-20 tokens.

Through the MAP Protocol, a peer-to-peer cross-chain interoperable network, BRC-20 community members can trade with other tokens on other chains more conveniently and at a lower cost. This layer of Bitcoin network cross-chain interoperability will also grow the Bitcoin community as a whole.


## **Drive Bitcoin ecosystem development and grow the Bitcoin community**

Bitcoin itself serves as a beacon for the whole industry, able to gather a more engaging and cohesive community with its strong security and decentralization mechanism. By enabling assets on other public chains to interact with the Bitcoin network, a larger Bitcoin community, and a more robust Bitcoin ecosystem will rise.

With MAP Protocol being Bitcoin layer-2,  any asset on any chain can easily interact with the Bitcoin network. This will add other types of assets and communities to the existing Bitcoin ecosystem and community. In this way, Bitcoin will be more than just a store of value but will extend interoperability and open doors for new types of decentralized applications and innovations.


# **The future of Bitcoin Ecosystem**

On October 31, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the[ Bitcoin Whitepaper,](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) defining Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system—that is, initiated by one party, accepted by another, and not dependent on any third-party institutions. Inspired by this, MAP Protocol has always carried on the belief of "peer-to-peer, no privileged third party." 

Throughout its research and development, it has repeatedly forwent the easier but centralized "shortcuts" and innovatively combined ZK (Zero-Knowledge Proofs), light client, and smart contract technologies to realize a purely peer-to-peer cross-chain verification network that relies on verification only, not any third party. 

MAP Protocol, as a Bitcoin Layer-2 network as well as a peer-to-peer interoperable omnichain network focused on cross-chain interoperability, is the Web3 gateway for developers and users. Whether it's further ensuring the security of the MAP Protocol through the Bitcoin network, leveling up BRC-20 community tradition experiences through BRC-201, or bringing more assets and users into the Bitcoin ecosystem, these are all initiatives and outcomes that the MAP Protocol community is pleased to see. As a steadfast member of the Bitcoin community, MAP Protocol hopes that more innovative Bitcoin scaling and interoperability solutions will emerge, making Satoshi Nakamoto's vision of decentralization a reality.
